# MotionDetectCam

## Project Overview
MotionDetectCam is a Python-based security camera application that utilizes OpenCV for motion detection. Designed to run on a PC with a connected camera, it detects motion in real-time and sends alerts to the user. The project also integrates AWS services for image storage and database management.

## Features
- [X] **Real-Time Motion Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV to detect motion in the camera feed.
- [ ] **Image Storage:** Captures images upon motion detection and stores them locally and on AWS S3.
- [ ] **Database Logging:** Logs motion events in an AWS DynamoDB table.
- [ ] **Notification System:** Sends notifications to the user via AWS SNS when motion is detected.
- [ ] **User Interface (Optional):** A simple web interface for viewing logs and captured images.

## Technology Stack
- **Python:** The core programming language used.
- **OpenCV:** For camera operations and motion detection.
- **AWS S3:** For storing captured images.
- **AWS DynamoDB:** For logging motion events.
- **AWS SNS:** For sending notifications to the user.
- **Flask (Optional):** For creating a user interface.
